# RISC-V Core Implementation
Ongoing project featuring the RTL development and UVM verification of a RISC-V core. First as a single-cycle processor, then upgrading to the canonical 5-stage piipeline, and then to an out-of-order execution microarchitecture. Self-directed project to acquaint myself with the RISC-V base ISA, and then to get some practice with industry CPU verification practices. Will eventually invlove integration with the RTL cache being worked on concurrently.

# Background
Project will begin in simulation before eventually ending in synthesis on Zynq7000. The RISC-V instruction set architecture is an open source, reduced instruction set architecture rapidly growing in popularity among startups and established chip designers alike.
