# RISC-V Core Implementation
Ongoing project featuring the RTL development and UVM verification of a RISC-V core. First as a single-cycle processor, then upgrading to the canonical 5-stage piipeline, and then to a multiprocessor system (only single-cycle core complete so far). Self-directed project to acquaint myself with the RISC-V base ISA, and then to get some practice with industry CPU verification practices. The subcomponents and top level system are being verified via a combination of directed and constrained-random UVM tests.
